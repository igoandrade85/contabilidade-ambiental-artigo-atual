2021-08-17,The Impact of Product Diversity on the Relationship Between Internationalization and Performance of Brazilian Multinational Companies,"The aim of this study was to investigate the moderating role of product diversification in the relationship between internationalization and the performance of Brazilian multinational companies. This study used internationalization data collected in reports from Fundação Dom Cabral, financial data collected in the Economática database, in addition to secondary data from 33 Brazilian companies collected on the website of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM). The work refers to an eight-year period (2010 to 2017), and used multiple linear regression with fixed effects and panel data. It was identified that the relationship between internationalization and performance of multinational Brazilian companies occurs in a U shape. Furthermore, a negative moderating role was identified in the relationship between product diversification and low-level internationalization, and a positive moderating effect on the performance of Brazilian companies internationalized with a high degree of product diversification. The present work innovated this theme for Brazilian literature by focusing on the moderating effect of product diversity. In addition, the article has implications for Brazilian multinational companies, as it can assist planning related to their international expansion, and also highlights that the beneficial effects of internationalization are not immediate; that the knowledge and experiences acquired in this process are important to improve its performance; and that after initial stages of the internationalization process, product diversification can help with an improvement in the performance of these companies.",Internacionalization.

2021-05-25,A model of social audit for university foundations,"The Social Audit is the report that informs about the socioeconomic relations of organizations with their social partners. The contemporary approach comprehends the vertices understood as the human resource balance, the demonstration of the added value, the environmental balance, the public and social responsibility of organizations. It is a more eclectic report than the traditional accounting reports, which makes it more capable of disclosing the efforts made by organizations to promote the management of their social responsibility. Although its study is very recent in Brazil, one notices a willingness, both in the business community and in the academia, to contribute to the discussions around the preparation and propagation of such a report. Thus, the article proposes a Social Audit for a university foundation as a useful report for the organization’s management and accountability towards its stakeholders. The adopted methodology consists of an exploratory research with a qualitative approach. The conclusions indicate the need for organizations to supplement the disclosure of information by adding to the economic and financial reports those of a social and environmental nature. The proposal focuses on the characteristics of higher education institutions of a communal nature in order to discuss the social dimension of these organizations and to contribute to the process of management of the social responsibilities resulting from their activities. Key words: social audit, university foundation, management of social responsibility.",,3,Sady Mazzioni,João Eduardo Prudêncio Tinoco,Antonio Benedito Silva Oliveira,,,,,,,,,,http://revistas.unisinos.br/index.php/base/article/view/5613,BASE (UNISINOS)
